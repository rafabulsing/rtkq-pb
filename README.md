# TODOs

- deal with optional files
- typecheck error in wrapper hooks
- handle tag invalidation for back relations
- typecheck filter option in query
- read config file with singular and plural names for the collections
- unit tests
  - will probably require breaking the types.mu template into multiple smaller templates
- hook to run script after every db schema change
- allow for partial updates (sending only some of the fields required)
- add TSDoc comment for other relevant properties of field
